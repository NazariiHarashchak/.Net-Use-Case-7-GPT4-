The Player class represents a player in a game and holds properties such as name, age, experience, and a list of skills. 
The PlayerAnalyzer class has a method called CalculateScore that takes a list of players as input. 
It calculates a score for each player based on their age, experience, and average skill level. 
The score is influenced by factors such as age and experience, and the contributions of all players are summed up to determine the final score.

The Student class represents a student and includes properties like name, age, grade, and boolean flags for exceptional students, 
honor roll students, and whether they passed. 
The StudentConverter class has a method called ConvertStudents that takes a list of students as input. 
It converts each student based on their grade and age, updating their properties accordingly. 
Students with high grades may be marked as exceptional or on the honor roll based on their age, while students with passing grades are marked as passed.

To set up and run the provided tests correctly, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider, etc.).
2. Add the necessary references to your project:
	- Make sure you have references to the System.Collections.Generic namespace and the UseCase_7 namespace.
	- Install the Xunit NuGet packages in the visual studio.
3. Copy the code for the PlayerAnalyzerTests and StudentConverterTest classes into separate test files within your project.
4. Build the project to ensure all the necessary dependencies are resolved.

5.Run the tests:
	- If you're using Visual Studio, you can use the built-in Test Explorer window to discover and run the tests.	
	- If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can use the "dotnet test" command in the terminal to run the tests.
	- If you're using JetBrains Rider, you can use the "Run" or "Debug" buttons next to each test method in the code editor.
6. Check the test results:
	- The test runner will execute each test method and report whether they pass or fail.
	- If any test fails, the runner will provide details about the failure, such as the expected and actual values.
	- If all tests pass, you should see a summary indicating the number of tests run and their overall result.
By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run the tests successfully for the PlayerAnalyzer and StudentConverter classes. 
The test cases cover different scenarios, ensuring that the code behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements.
